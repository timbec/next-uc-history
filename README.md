This is the latest iteration of a front end for the 'Uranium City History' website, which exists at:

http://uraniumcity-history.com

The current site is built on Wordpress. It was the second site I ever built, and it's aging. However, there is a great deal of legacy content that I want to keep, and it is still popular with the community of (mostly former) Uranium City residents.

One facet of this site, which I want to enhance in this iteration, is the amount of people who write in with comments and stories of their own, usually in response to a story I've posted on the site. Gatsby is a popular front-end for Wordpress, but my understanding is that Next.js is a better alternative for interactive websites. So Next.js it is.

In the beginning stages, I'll be working off this: https://dev.to/kendalmintcode/configuring-wordpress-as-a-headless-cms-with-next-js-3p1o

then documenting my own development at: https://tim-beckett.com/blog
